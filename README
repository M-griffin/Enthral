Notes: 6/9/2017, This document is way outdated and doesn't apply anymore.
A New document will be written up shortly, until then a few basic's... 

The Gist is:  

1. Compile jamlib in root/src/jamlib folder  
make or make -f makefile.linux


./autogen.sh    to build configure script
./configure     to build make files
make            to compile, depending on CPU use -j#   # being 1,2,3,4 for cpu's available to make it compile faster.

once the system is compiled, you can compile small programs off src folder.
stats
telnetd

./build.sh     to compile in each folder

next is grab the data file archive linked on the page,  then copy the executables to root of the folder so it has access 
to data, menu, ansi screens

Enthral is pretty much a tinker development system, it's incomplete in a lot of areas and a rewrite has 
begun and renamed to Oblivion/2 XRM with a new code base.  Feel free to play with and learn to your hearts content.
Also check out the new stuff.. it's coming along..

Enthral BBS - 18/10/2010 Build 429 Alpha.  (OUT DATED BELOW)!

Notes:

Menu Command Added MF for Force Message Scan, this will now return to previous area, 
 ie after a force scan on system announcement.

/=/====================================================================================================
There are two ways to install Enthral.  The manual way (which some people
enjoy since they get a kick out of having full control) and the automated
way via the install.pl script.

We have detailed instructions for both steps as well as an auto update
scripts that will update and compile your current Enthral install via
the svn.

/=/====================================================================================================
Auto Install.

For those of you that would rather have every dependancy and the sysop name/
bbs name changed in the code for you we have an automated perl script that
will do all the heavy lifting for you.  If you interested in having your
system do everything for you, all you need to do is run the following:

./install.pl

You need to have perl installed on your system to use the install script.

/=/====================================================================================================
Manual Install.

Remember things are still very incomplete so still there are not a lot of
options for many things, but I'm working on it.. :)

You can get the source through svn thanks to Netsurge.

 $ svn --username svn co http://svn.enthralbbs.com /your/path/enthral

If it asks for a password just hit ENTER or leave it blank.

Before you can compile you need the Husky SMAPI lib, this is for jam message
support.

You can get the latest 2.4 RC5 from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/husky/

 *Note, Some people have had problem with 2.4, if you get crashes in message
 scanning, please switch to 2.2-Stable Release.

Go into the source directory, rename makefile.lnx to Makefile (case sensitive)
and run make. This will generate the libsmapilnx.a which is needed by the bbs,
copy this to the src directory for enthral and your all set.

*Note, Both BSD and Linux will compile correctly with the makefile.lnx

After smapi is all set and compiles cleanly:

You have to edit the config.ini file located in the ini folder.  Here you will
add the handle/username of your sysop user.  It should match exactly case and
all.  Soon there will be a user editor where you can assign a sysop flag.

Now that we have made all the necessary changes to the code, we can now run
configure and make.  At a shell just type the following...

/=/====================================================================================================

# First run autogen.sh to generate a multi-platform configure script.

./autogen.sh

# Now run configure and make to build the system, if you have any pronlems,
# try running 'make distclean' then re-run 'make', make sure the libsmapilnx.a library
# is placed in your src folder before running make, it's a dependancy.

./configure && make

We still have two small binaries to build to ensure that Enthral runs nice and
smooth.  Stats is used to generate top callers and posters and Snoop allows
you to see what's going on when a user is logged in.

/=/====================================================================================================
For Stats

Stats is located in src/stats.  You will need to change the path statement in
main.cpp to match the path of your enthral setup. Inside of main.cpp change
the following line to your path.

 Line 19 - PATH = "/home/merc/enthral/src/";

Once you have made the change run the following at a prompt to compile stats.

    g++ -o stats main.cpp process2.cpp userdat.cpp

You will also need to edit [CommandRec009] in src/menu/logon.txt to the proper
location of the stats binary we just compiled.

/=/====================================================================================================
For Snoop

Go to the src/snoop directory and execute the following from a prompt.

    g++ -o snoop snoop.cpp

/=/====================================================================================================
Post Compile.

The first thing you'll want to do it connect to the bbs,  and create your
sysop user, the name should match exactly what you updated in the logon.cpp.

Now once your at the main menu, as a Sysop you can hit * from the main menu
to go into the message forum editor.

You will want to create an email area as your first area, and a system
announcements as your second area.  Your system annoucements area must be
named "system" (no quotes) to ensure that only a sysop can post in it.  This
will be fixed later on.

After these 2 areas, you can create general message and as many areas as you
like.

Once you are done creating your areas, hit C to compile them.

Once everything is compiled and working, you'll want to setup xindetd, and
telnetd to login to the bbs.  If your unsure how to set either one of them
up, send me a message and i'll email you some sample scripts.  ddtelnetd is
automatically setup for you when running the install.pl script.

Your all done.

If you have any questions feel free to email me or Netsurge and we'll try
to help you out.

/=/====================================================================================================
Auto update

There is a script in the root dir called update.pl.  This script will
automatically update your to the latest build via svn and replace all the
instances of the default sysop and bbs name in the source code.  It will also
run configure, make clean, and make for you.  This should make updating your
installation a lot easier.

/=/====================================================================================================
One last note

You can also add |IP MCI Code for ip address in the matrix ansi
file, i took this out while I was hunting a bug a while back and forgot to
add it back in.. ;)

You can always pop into #enthral on irc.bbs-scene.org and ask for help.  I try
to pop in nightly and answer any questions, but you can also chat with
Netsurge, Esc, and even pook who have also setup the bbs for testing.
